# Peer-graded-Assignment-Prediction-Assignment-Writeup

IntroductionThe goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Model builtThe expacted outcome variable is classe, a 5 level of factor variable. In this dataset, participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in 5 different fashion: Class A - excatly according to the specification, Class B - throwing the elbows to the front, Class c- lifting the dumbbell only halfway, Class D - lowering the dumbbell only halfway, Class E - throwing the hips to the front.
